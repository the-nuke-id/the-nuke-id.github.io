      <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Through nothing something was formed. Through something nothing was formed</p>

      <p> I have and I suppose I always will disdain extremism as the above sentence even in poetry. Not only do they make no sense they are also quite powerful in propagating a contagious mentality of transactional ac-
tions demanding profit out of the simplest things. This mentality then seeps in daily life and trivilises the fundamental concept of unconditional joy. </p>
      <p>Sad to say this mentality has already seeped deep in our general social psyche. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It is, at this point, so deep that the concept of unconditional joy is no more a fundamental state everyone is privy to at any moment</span>
 but is rather an earned and achieved state of Buddhist Nirvana you have to “make” time to practice to be able to do.</p>

      <p> It is as impossibly solvable as it is sad to realise that even the simple joy of sunbathing is granted only if you’re either the privileged or the mentally skewed who, with either the lack <sup>(or ability to afford the lack)</sup> of a suffering environment or the mental faculty to be aware of with, can feel the soft warmth of a glowing Sun on the many many folds of their skin with no figurative self-and-socially-imposed timer of success that labels
this encounter with the Sun a loss of happiness.<br>
Like Silvio Dante says - 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Time is a great enemy.</span> </p>

  <p>I have been given a few “solutions” for this problem. The two prominent being either to compartmentalise my psyche or to, as mentioned before, practicing achieving a state of Buddhist Nirvana before the office
slack call begins</p>

<p>The latter is asinine. While the former is psychotic.<br>
Asinine because instead of targeting the root problem it merely affords you bliss to bear it.<sup>(although it is hardly "mere")</sup><br>
Psychotic because like Nathaniel Hawthorne said -
<span style="font-style:italic;"><br>No man can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which one is true.</span>
</p>

<p>Discounting the sheer resilience of practitioners of either of these solutions would not be wisdom as in the fact of a travesity I aforementioned mentioned as “impossibly solvable” a fragment of pure inspiration
can be witnessed in these practitioners rebelling sisyphean odds with both of their tiny hands</p>

<p>I, however, being a carrier of humble flesh and bones, find it equally impossibly difficult to averse myself from the despicable flawed system of society that asks me sacrifice before I can enjoy the warmth of the
Sun</p>

<p> Through nothing something was formed. Through something nothing was formed</p>
