      <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">Through nothing something was formed. Through something nothing was formed.</p>

      <p> I have lately come to disdain extremism as in the above sentence even in poetry. Not only do they seem to make no sense they also seem quite powerful in propagating a contagious mentality of transactional actions demanding profit out of the simplest things. This mentality then seeps in the daily life and trivilises the fundamental concept of unconditional joy. </p>
      <p>I would not be unwise to be sad to say that this mentality may have already seeped deep in our general social psyche. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It , at this point, may even be so deep that the concept of unconditional joy may no more be a fundamental state everyone is privy to at any moment</span>
 but rather an earned and achieved state of Buddhist Nirvana one has to “make” time to practice to be able to reap joy from the everday mundane.</p>

      <p> It is as impossibly solvable as it is disheartening and semi-mature to realise that even the simple joy of sunbathing is granted only if you’re either the privileged or the mentally skewed who, with either the lack <sup>(or ability to afford the lack)</sup> of a suffering environment or the mental faculty to be aware of with, can feel the soft warmth of a glowing Sun on the many many folds of their skin with no figurative self-and-socially-imposed timer of success that labels
this encounter with the Sun a loss of happiness.<br>
For most the reality is what Silvio Dante says - 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Time is a great enemy.</span> </p>

  <p>I have been given a few “solutions” for this problem. The two prominent ones being either to compartmentalise my psyche or to, as mentioned before, practice achieving a state of Buddhist Nirvana before the office
slack call begins</p>

<p>The latter is asinine. While the former is psychotic.<br>
Asinine because instead of targeting the root problem it merely affords you bliss to bear it.<sup>(although it is hardly "mere")</sup><br>
Psychotic because like Nathaniel Hawthorne said -
<span style="font-style:italic;"><br>No man can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which one is true.</span>
</p>

<p>Discounting the sheer resilience of practitioners of either of these solutions would not be wise. In the face of a travesity I aforementioned deemed “impossibly solvable” a fragment of pure inspiration <sup>(although whether it is rooted in rebellion or stupidity, i cannot discern)</sup>
can be witnessed in these practitioners rebelling sisyphean odds with the entirety of both of their tiny hands</p>

<p>I, however, being a carrier of humble flesh and bones, find it equally impossibly difficult to averse myself from the despicable flawed system of society that asks me sacrifice before I can enjoy the warmth of the
Sun. And so... </p>

<p> Through nothing I was formed. Through me nothing was formed.</p>
