    <div class="article_body">
      <p style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">The Ocean rumbled and tumbled my humble Ship.</p>

      <p>Usually I steer clear from advocating definitive needs but this one I would advocate.<br>
In my humble and honest opinion, One needs an <font color="#fe9171">ambition</font>.<br>
And by <font color="#fe9171">ambition</font>s I do not mean goals. That would almost be an insult to the former.
<sup><font color="#bebebe">(although I don't like advocating such comparisons either. Goals are, in their own merit, incandescent as well.)</font></sup></p>

<p>
To get a better understanding of my understanding of <font color="#fe9171">ambition</font>, lets imagine a ship at sea and the North <font color="#fffa86">Star</font>.<br>
Ships lost at sea have come to rely on the North <font color="#fffa86">star</font> to find their way back home for centuries now.<br>
And although I haven't been quite up-to-date with my knowledge of modern ship schematics 
<sup><font color="#bebebe">(I'm sure they've installed compass along with Bluetooth, GPS and Spotify in ships now)</font></sup> the North <font color="#fffa86">star</font> can still be found every single night far out there shining brightly and steadily, helping the lost find their way back home.<br>
And if the concept of <span style="font-style: italic">"it's not the destination, it's the journey"</span> rings true, then it can be crudely inferred that the North <font color="#fffa86">star</font> provides the path to a fulfilling journey.<br>
Without it, there would be no direction, no journey, no hope of reaching no destination.<br>
Without the North <font color="#fffa86">star</font> there would only be <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> wanderings that never lead nobody nowhere.</span><br>
</p>

<p>
<font color="#fe9171">Ambition</font> is this North <font color="#fffa86">star</font>.
</p>

<p>
Man has always been a marvelous and pitiful creature.<br>
He has been given the boon of analysis which is ironically the bane of paralysis. Without the North <font color="#fffa86">star</font> of <font color="#fe9171">ambition</font>, Man, in all his analysis, is left to scavenge at the footrest of his immediate material world in an attempt to fill his allotted days with tasks, goals and to-dos that ultimately are no different than the aforementioned wanderings that never lead nobody nowhere. And in the wake of the realisation of the gift of conscious intelligence and the wisdom in knowing the easiness with which one gets lost in the complexity of this gift, it is the necessity of every man to have an <font color="#fe9171">ambition</font>.
</p>

<p>
It is a necessity that he recognise this North <font color="#fffa86">star</font>, and day in day out, with thought, without doubt, move in the direction of his destination.<br>
It is absolutely necessary for a man to undertake a journey.
</p>

<p>
It is imperative that he discard the expectations of <b>immediate</b> profitable returns 
<sup>(I talked more about this mentality in my <a href="../05/On_Something_to_Nothing.html"> <font color="#bebebe">
<span style="font-size  : 120% ;"> last post</span></font></a>)</sup>, discard insecure comparisons with his peers, strictly refuse to let the world and all it's forces coddle him into losing the sight of this <font color="#fe9171">ambition</font> no matter the oppression, no matter the morale, no matter the poverty. Even a gaze at the <font color="#fffa86">star</font> is enough.
</p>

<p>
Even if the Sea be wreathing continuous havoc on your ship.<br>
Even if the thunderous sky and the rumbling ocean tumble your Ship on a meandering path. Never lose the sight of your north <font color="#fffa86">star</font>.<br>
And if the sky is too cloudy and the <font color="#fffa86">star</font> cannot be seen and has not been seen for years, for decades and you find yourself hopelessly lost at the thundering, rumbling, tumbling position, know that behind those cloud the <font color="#fffa86">star</font> still shines steady and bright. 
</p>

<p>
And if this pursuit led to the worst.<br>
If the thrust of the waves were to finally topple your Ship and the comfort of Death arrives.<br>
Let it.
</p>

<p>
There was no significance to you without the <font color="#fffa86">star</font> anyway.<br>
Who were you before you were who you think you are. Who knows.<br>
Who are the people around you who you think you know who they are. Who knows.<br>
Before your soul was picked from the space of souls to be in the shell of the flesh you now possess, You had always been a wanderer wandering on wanderings that never lead nobody nowhere.<br>
And so if in it's pursuit Death was to caress and cover your ship in it's thin black veil, <br>all you would cease to be is just one sailor.
