    On Strength : Tending to your garden

    <div class="article_body">
      <p class ="quote" style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">You are only as good as your garden.</p>

      <p>Every man must see how weak he is.<br>
There's no haven from reality even if you avert your mental gaze and meditate yourself into a happy place.<br>
Every man must see how his weak body limits him.<br>
Every man must see how his weak mind puts him closer to an animal than a man.<br>
Every man must see how his weak heart limits how kind he can be to himself and others.<br></p>

<p>
Life is simple but difficult.<br>
And the natural inclination of the animal-man's weak mind complicates the simplicity to victimise itself into the center of an impossibly large web of conspiracies that it believes, by the position and circumstances of its birth, is unable untangle.<br>
But there is no need to untangle this web. There is no web.<br>
There is only a garden with three impossibly tall trees - mind, body and heart. <br>
You are standing at the foot of these trees. You always have. <br>
You are eating the fruits falling from these impossibly tall trees. You always have. And the size, the sweetness, the abundance is dependent on the care you have put in these trees. And they have always been cared for. Either by volition or by omission.<br>
Sure there is semi-maturity in realising that because of the position and circumstances of your birth the size, the care given to your garden by your guardians in your childhood years and the consequent state of your garden is different from somebody else's garden, but there is no bigger immaturity than abstaining from caring for it altogether on account of having been made to see this disparity by your semi-mature mind.<br>
True maturity is in visualising the complete potential of this garden and then, with the entirely of your tiny palms, care for it until the door of the garden opens and you are no longer there.<br>
This is your garden. The only one you will ever have.<br>
Not to say to be nimble and resign to this disparity. Breed envy if you'd like. Competiting is necessary. <br>
</p>

<p>
But the upkeep of this garden is barely a foundation for strength. The bare minimum.<br>
A strong man with a strong body, mind and heart then resigns himself to a purpose. <a class ="post_link" href="../07/On_Ambition.html">An ambition.</a><br>
And with an unwavering resolve works towards that ambition.<br>
The strongest of men work towards social service. Towards the betterment of everyone around them. Towards education and educating.<br>
We are, sadly, an civilisation plagued by ignorance and distracted by distractions.<br>
Before you are able to do that however, tend first to your garden.<br>
</p>

<p>
Here, I want to refrain from empowering the already indolant animal-man who absolutely adores an excuse to be more indolant while fooling itself as a competent gardener. <br>
The animal-man is marvellously talented at instantly foolish his mind by seeing the minimum to-do in a noble pursuit, doing the minimum, and believing he's on a noble pursuit which absolves him of any further exertion to any of the other more immediate alerts in his life.
<sup>(Your usual Mark Manson fan)</sup><br>
This is no to-do. Do what you will.<br>
Your garden is your own.<br> 
But if in case you are an animal-man who would like to be a better gardener and a better man <sup>(and animal-men almost always do. It is usually in their firm animalistic nature to subscribe to regurgigated ideas of vulture-esque "motivational speakers" (like Mark Manson) to absolve themselves of any thinking on their part)</sup> then I have no advice for you. It is your own duty to think like a man. <br>
Your garden is your own. <br>
